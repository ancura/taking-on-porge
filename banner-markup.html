<!--

You can store your banner HTML markup here.
If you need to, you can also put the hed and dek in here.
Sometimes, it's easier to store that here for responsive styles
than it is in the default hed/dek output area.

This is just for your use. It doesn't need to be uploaded to the server.

CSS and JS links should not go in this area. Use the
Use Article Assets instead.
